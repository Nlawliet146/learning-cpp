# Learning C++

This repository contains my personal C++ learning files.

The code examples here were written while following the **BroCode C++ free course** on YouTube.  
I have added my own explanations, comments, and notes to understand the concepts better and build a clear reference for myself.

**Purpose of this repo:**
- Document my progress while learning C++
- Store example programs with easy-to-understand notes
- Practice clean coding and reinforce C++ fundamentals
- Build a reference for future projects

All comments, explanations, and additional notes are written by me (with some help from ChatGPT for clarity).  
The examples are for learning only and are not exact copies of any tutorial.

Feel free to explore or use these examples for your own learning.
